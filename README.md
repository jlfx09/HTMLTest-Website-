Start with opening the folder and accessing the folder in git bash

then use git init -b main followed by git add . or git add "file name".

Then to commit changes, use command git commit -m "comment".

then use command  git remote add origin [URL]

followed by git push origin main to see changes in GITHUB Repository.
